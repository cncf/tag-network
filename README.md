## Introduction
The CNCF Networking Technical Advisory Group(TAG) is dedicated to fostering innovation and best practices in cloud native networking. With the rapid rise in popularity of distributed microservices architectures, robust and efficient networking has become of prime importance for servicing critical workloads.

We aim to clarify fundamental networking concepts, promote and monitor networking-related projects under CNCF, as well as facilitate collaboration and set clear standards within the cloud native ecosystem.

Please note that the TAG Network does not work alone. It advances close communication and knowledge-sharing with other CNCF groups and external organizations to discover leading practices and promote consistent messaging. This collaborative approach ensures that TAG Network stays at the forefront of cloud-native networking advancements, and provide guidance to the broader developer community.

The [TAG Network Charter](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/tag-charters/network-charter.md) details the scope and responsibilities of your group.

## Project List
Projects under this TAG can be found in the [CNCF Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/?group=projects-and-products&view-mode=grid&tag=network), typically listed under Streaming &amp; Messaging, Service Mesh, Remote Procedure Call(RPC), Coordination &amp; Service Discovery, Service Proxy, API Gateway and Cloud Native Network.

## Working Groups and Teams
The working groups under TAG Network lead diverse initiatives to address various networking challenges and opportunities within the cloud native ecosystem. This includes bringing together community members and industry experts to facilitate knowledge sharing and necessary publication of initiatives' results. They also cover exploring networking technology and concepts, as well as promoting common design patterns and best practices. They play a crucial role in shaping networking in cloud native environments by identifying gaps, driving consensus and promoting innovation.
